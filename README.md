# Telegraf SNMP Image with some popular MIBs.

Special thanks to nuntz/telegraf-snmp and weldpua2008/docker-net-snmp, but we've switched to only using telegraf as the base image.

amd64 and arm64 arch supported.

## Current collection of additional MIB files

- Synology
- Dell PowerEdge
- MikroTik

> PRs and issues welcome! Looking for community feedback for what MIBs people are using.
